# LitePlacer-Upper_Camera-Mount-Short
**This is a redesign of the LitePlacer upper camera mount. **

One of the issues that some people have encountered with the standard mount that comes with the LitePlacer, is the mount size is long in the Y axis direction, causing it collide with certain feeders.

This design shortens the mount and still retains the three axis adjustments. The front horizontial gear adjustment had to be done away with but this adjustment can still be done using a flat head screwdriver, by leveraging the teeth on the camera base against the cradle.

All the parts that compose the mount were modified to create this design. The only parts that are the original shape and size are the LED ring light mounts.

This repo has STL and 3mf files for all the mount parts.
